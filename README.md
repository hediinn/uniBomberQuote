# uniBomberQuote
This repo is for me to experiment in diffrent languges, a implementation of a quote genirator

This is the c# part, to run you nead mcs and mono installed and make

to run it you can either build with: "mcs main.cs" and then: "mono main.exe"

you can also just run the make file with: "make"
